# ROS-node
The scripts on this GitHub repository are part of a lab to get you started on ROS nodes. Practice with three "flavors" of nodes and arduino communication. All documentation has been taken from the ROS website and can be found there. I highly recommend installing Arduino first and arduino ros serial node to work with it.
